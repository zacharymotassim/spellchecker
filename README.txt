All functionality works. I found the most trouble in getting an accurate probe count and The spelling
correction cases.

in order to run on terminal you type make clean then make all.

Terminal commands for each part:

linear probing: ./create_and_test_hash words.txt query_words.txt linear
quadratic probing: ./create_and_test_hash words.txt query_words.txt quadratic
double hashing: ./create_and_test_hash words.txt query_words.txt double
spell check; ./spell_check document_1.txt wordsEn.txt
R values used for testing: 89, 97, 53, 41. All values are prime and less than the size of the table.
